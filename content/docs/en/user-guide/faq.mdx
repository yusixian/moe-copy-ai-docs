## Installation Issues

## Usage Issues

### Why can't some websites be extracted?

Possible reasons:

1. **Page not fully loaded**
   - Wait for complete loading
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Dynamic content**
   - Switch to "manual capture" mode
   - Wait for content to load before clicking extension

3. **Protected pages**
   - Some sites (banks, payment pages) restrict extension access
   - This is a browser security limitation

### Extracted content incomplete or incorrect?

Solutions:

1. **Switch extraction modes**
   ```
   Selector Mode → Reading Mode → Hybrid Mode
   ```

2. **Configure custom selectors**
   - Open options page
   - Add site-specific selectors
   - Validate with test tools

   - Check usage quota

3. **Network connection**

   - Check proxy settings

## Performance Issues

### Extension running slowly?

Optimization methods:

1. **Reduce log output**
